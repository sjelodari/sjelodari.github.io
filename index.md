## Welcome to Saber's personal website

I am Saber Jelodari, a bachelor student in biomedical engineering at Islamic Azad University of Tabriz (IAUT).

### Research Interests

* Image & signal processing
* Simulation and analysis of complex systems (incl. neuroscience)
* System design for biomedical systems

### My projects

So far I have experince of working on various system projects from collecting data to analysis using Wavelet-Transform and buidling signal processing systems in Matlab.

Post 1: In this project I have looked into comparing performance of a simple implementation on a FPGA (hardware) and a processor (sofrware).

Post 2: In this project I have worked on training a neural network to detect images in a particular dataset using Matlab.
